			<h1>About</h1>

			<p>
				Web developers are professionals who specialize in creating and
				maintaining websites and web applications. They use various programming
				languages, frameworks, and tools to develop websites and web
				applications that can run on the internet.
			</p>

			<p>
				Web developers are responsible for designing the layout and user
				interface of websites, developing the functionality and features of web
				applications, testing and debugging code, and ensuring that websites are
				responsive, scalable, and secure. They may also be involved in website
				optimization and search engine optimization (SEO) to improve the
				website's visibility and performance.
			</p>

			<p>
				There are several different types of web developers, including front-end
				developers, back-end developers, and full-stack developers. Front-end
				developers are responsible for the user-facing part of the website,
				including the design, layout, and functionality. Back-end developers
				work on the server-side of web development, handling data storage,
				application logic, and server-side scripting. Full-stack developers have
				expertise in both front-end and back-end development.
			</p>

			<p>
				Web development requires knowledge of programming languages such as
				HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as web development frameworks such as
				React, Angular, and Vue. Other technologies used in web development
				include databases such as MySQL and MongoDB, server-side scripting
				languages such as PHP and Python, and web servers such as Apache and
				Nginx.
